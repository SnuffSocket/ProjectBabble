## Installation
### Windows
Head to the releases section and [download the latest installer](https://github.com/Project-Babble/ProjectBabble/releases/latest).

### Linux
Install `git`, `curl` and a version of `python` greater than `3.8` for your distro. 

Then, copy paste and run the following script into the terminal of your choice:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dfgHiatus/a92a3caae24c1bfab1c7544537a654c5/raw/fc30aa550c3c7aa83c37a72168e75ef92388e39b/project-babble-install.sh)"
```

Once it's finished installing, you can update and run the Babble app by typing `babble-app` into your terminal.

*You should also be able to run the Windows executable through Wine!*

#### Notes:
If you receive a `["Error listing UVC devices on Linux ... No such file or directory"]` when choosing/changing your camera, you'll need to install video4linux (`v4l-utils`) for your distro.

For Ubuntu or other distros with apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils
```

If you receive a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'` error message on run, you'll need to install `tkinter` for your distro.

For Ubuntu or other distros with apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```
